/**
 * üí¢ Questions
 * üü° Please, answer on them before moving further and after changes would be made
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ How the configuration changes are handled with Feature (if so)?
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ Can we have MVI using ViewModel or Presenter?
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ Could the race conditions issue happen
 *
 * IMO, I don't think that the implementation of MVI should be like this.
 * The architecture is the very crucial pilar for any app.
 * Usually, the implementation is unique for a project as there is no the strict rules how to do it.
 *
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ You are relying on the third-party framework which is used presumably in the closed group
 *    of people. Meaning we are as externals won't know about actual motivation and appetite of
 *    existed functionality and further updates of the framework.
 *    Doing so, we explicitly agree with those limitation where we won;t be able to customize it.
 *    The workarounds would appear. Plus, imagine the owner company is closed, and the framework
 *    won't be supported. So, your app become outdated pretty fast. üßê
 *
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ Years ago, I've used Mavericks framework in one of pet projects. But there we decided
 *    to do so as the Kotlin language wasn't powerful at that moment. But now it's pretty stable with
 *    having Flows and Channels. Or... it's possible to use Rx instead where we have Observable and
 *    PublishSubject. It's up to you what to use - Rx or Kotlin, but I would recommend to focus on
 *    Kotlin üòâ
 *
 *    Material:
 *    üí† "Implementation drafts with using only Kotlin"
 *       https://betterprogramming.pub/all-you-need-for-mvi-is-kotlin-how-to-reduce-without-reducer-5e986856610f
 *
 *    üí¢ But... please, check the second material as it would prevent writing a wrong solution
 *    üí† "THIS Is the #1 Clean Code Mistake"
 *       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYetmv0xRRI
 *
 *    üôè We shouldn't use base classes in all costs
 *
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ Having Feature instead of ViewModel/Presenter makes confuse üò•. Usually, we are as an Android
 *    engineers prefer work with the intermediate presentation component - ViewModel or Presenter only.
 *    I don't think it's a good thing to keep alive as it increases the learning curve.
 *    We should keep things as simple as possible. So, we can-should have VM or Presenter with
 *    the implementation of MVI concept. Try to consider it as an upgrade/level-up of VM or Presenter.
 *
 *    Material:
 *    üí† Not theoretical comparison of MVVM and MVI

 *
 * 4Ô∏è‚É£ Regarding the naming convention we should stick to Event, State, SideEffect (if needed)
